## Hi there 👋
I'm Angel, a Computer Engineer New Grad based in United States.

I mostly love working with Python, but have used HTML/CSS and Javascript for web development.

I have used various frameworks for these programming languages such as: Pandas, Mediapipe, Numpy, Scikit-learn, and React.

Currently learning more about Machine Learning and its implementations into Robotics.
